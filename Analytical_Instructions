Analytical Instructions
Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide on the analysis of the correlation between views and likes on YouTube videos using Tableau.

Objectives
The primary goal of this analysis is to understand if there's a significant correlation between the number of views a YouTube video receives and the number of likes it garners.

Data Source
Our dataset has been sourced from Kaggle's 'YouTube Trending Video Dataset', which provides daily updates on trending video statistics. The key attributes of interest in this dataset are 'views', 'likes', 'dislikes', and 'comment_count'.

Methodology
The analysis is broken down into the following steps:

1. Setting Up Tableau
Downloading and installing Tableau Desktop.
Familiarization with Tableau's interface and features.
2. Data Importing
Loading the dataset into Tableau.
Initial review of data types and fields.
3. Data Cleaning
Filtering out unnecessary rows or null values.
Renaming fields for clarity.
Creating calculated fields as necessary.
4. Visualizing Correlation
Creating a scatter plot with 'views' on the x-axis and 'likes' on the y-axis.
Adjusting visual elements for clarity.
5. Adding a Trend Line
Including a linear trend line in the scatter plot to visualize correlation.
6. Calculating the Correlation Coefficient
Creating a calculated field for the Pearson correlation coefficient.
Displaying the correlation coefficient on the visualization.
7. Further Exploration
Considering other visualizations like histograms to understand distributions.
Investigating secondary metrics for deeper insights.
Results Interpretation
